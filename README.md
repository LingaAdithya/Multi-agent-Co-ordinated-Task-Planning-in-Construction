<p align="center">
  <img src="demos/demo.gif" width="800"/>
</p>

A collaborative research and simulation project that integrates **multi-agent systems**, **computer vision**, and **AI-based planning** to model, analyse, and visualise coordinated task execution in a construction-site environment.

This repository represents the **combined work of the entire team**, including:
- 🎮 A **Unity-based multi-agent construction simulation**
- 🤖 **AI / ML experimentation using Google Colab** (YOLO fine-tuning and other models)
- 🧠 Algorithmic approaches for task coordination and planning

## 🎮 Opening the Unity Simulation

### Prerequisites
- **Unity Hub**
- **Unity Editor (LTS version recommended, as used by the team)**

### Steps to Open
1. Open **Unity Hub**
2. Click **Open Project**
3. Select the **root folder of this repository**
4. Unity will automatically load:
   - `Assets`
   - `Packages`
   - `ProjectSettings`

> ⚠️ Important  
> The `Library/` folder is intentionally excluded from version control.  
> Unity regenerates it automatically on first launch.

Construction tasks are modeled as a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**, ensuring correct execution order through dependency constraints. Multiple robots dynamically select available tasks and execute them in parallel whenever possible. Each agent navigates a 2D grid using Manhattan movement while continuously checking for occupancy conflicts. In case of conflicts, a **priority-based arbitration mechanism** resolves deadlocks by allowing higher-priority agents to proceed. Upon task completion, the system updates the DAG and releases agents to take on newly available tasks, enabling efficient and coordinated execution.
